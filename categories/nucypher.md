### [zerodb](https://github.com/nucypher/zerodb) by [nucypher](https://github.com/nucypher)  
*This project is no longer actively maintained. If you'd like to become the maintainer, please let us know.* ZeroDB is an end-to-end encrypted database. Data can be stored and queried on untrusted database servers without ever exposing the encryption key. Clients can execute remote queries against the encrypted data without downloading all of it or suffering an excessive performance hit.
